# An-integrative-analysis-of-clinical-and-epigenetic-biomarkers-of-mortality

We built all-cause mortality prediction models using clinical risk factors and DNA methyaltion CpGs as input features. CpGs were selected based on the meta-analysis of 10 cohorts including CHS, DTR, ESTHER, InCHIANTi, KORA F4, LBC 1921, LBC 1936, NAS, RS and WHI (See our paper, under review in Genome Biology). The prediction models were trained in the FHS cohort using four methods including Elastic net - Cox proportional hazards method (Elastic-coxph), Random survival forest (RSF), Cox-nnet, and DeepSurv. The outcome is all-cause mortality.

The prediction models were avaliable in the folder: /PredictionModels, and the codes are for using the model for prediction were in the folder: /Codes.
